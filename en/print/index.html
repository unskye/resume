                    <li>The key therapeutic targets of Chronic Kidney Disease is glomerular pathological changes. However, manual analysis of WSI is time-consuming, and CNN, ViT, and other mainstream automation frameworks are difficult to solve the three major challenges of local texture discriminability, spatial heterogeneity, and morphological prior integration.</li>
                    <li>This project designs a dual-stage decoder framework <strong>DualSeg</strong>: the Wave-Swin module is used to solve the problem of local feature modeling, the VRWKV module is employed to achieve long-range dependency capture, and a lightweight decoder is integrated to accomplish multi-scale feature fusion. These three core designs each correspond to one of the three aforementioned challenges.</li>
                    <li>To verify its performance, DualSeg was compared with 11 SOTA models on the KPIs and HuBMAP datasets, demonstrating the optimal comprehensive performance: on the KPIs test set, it achieves an average mDSC of 92.98% and obtains the lowest HD95 scores in each category; on the private/public subsets of HuBMAP, it reaches an average mDSC of 89.79% and 83.73% respectively. These results fully confirm the robustness of DualSeg and its breakthrough value in overcoming the core challenges of renal pathological segmentation.</li>

                <li>In the pathological analysis of colorectal cancer, the proportion relying on manual analysis is high, with defects of inefficiency and subjectivity. The existing technologies do not fully utilize the features of multi-color spaces. In this study, three color spaces, namely RGB, HSV, and LAB*, were compared. By combining traditional features (such as 3D GLCM) with deep features (such as ResNet), a multi-color and multi-feature fusion framework was constructed. On the Kather dataset, the classification accuracy rate reached as high as 98.60%, which helps with themated analysis of the patholog autoy of colorectal cancer.</li>
