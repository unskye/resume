                    <li>The key therapeutic targets of Chronic Kidney Disease is glomerular pathological changes. However, manual analysis of WSI is time-consuming, and CNN, ViT, and other mainstream automation frameworks are difficult to solve the three major challenges of local texture discriminability, spatial heterogeneity, and morphological prior integration.</li>
                    <li>This project designs a dual-stage decoder framework <strong>DualSeg</strong>: the Wave-Swin module is used to solve the problem of local feature modeling, the VRWKV module is employed to achieve long-range dependency capture, and a lightweight decoder is integrated to accomplish multi-scale feature fusion. These three core designs each correspond to one of the three aforementioned challenges.</li>
                    <li>To verify its performance, DualSeg was compared with 11 SOTA models on the KPIs and HuBMAP datasets, demonstrating the optimal comprehensive performance: on the KPIs test set, it achieves an average mDSC of 92.98% and obtains the lowest HD95 scores in each category; on the private/public subsets of HuBMAP, it reaches an average mDSC of 89.79% and 83.73% respectively. These results fully confirm the robustness of DualSeg and its breakthrough value in overcoming the core challenges of renal pathological segmentation.</li>

                    <!-- <li><strong>Background:</strong> Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) impacts over 9% of the global population, with its core histological features being glomerulosclerosis and renal interstitial fibrosis—making glomerular pathological changes a key target for CKD treatment. However, expert manual analysis, annotation, and diagnosis of glomeruli in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) are highly time-consuming and labor-intensive, creating an urgent demand for automated, high-precision glomerular segmentation tools. Existing solutions such as CNNs and ViTs fall short in addressing three core challenges of glomerular images: local textural variability, spatial heterogeneity, and multi-scale morphological priors, resulting in a lack of unified and effective automated approaches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Task:</strong> The project aimed to develop a robust automated framework that integrates local feature extraction and global context modeling within a single unified architecture. This framework needed to overcome the limitations of traditional models, achieve high-precision segmentation for complex pathological glomeruli (e.g., fibrotic or morphologically variant glomeruli), and ultimately provide a practical automated tool for renal histopathological analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Methodoloogy:</strong> We designed DualSeg, a dual-stage hybrid framework combining CNN and VRWKV. In the early stage, Wave-Swin blocks were deployed to dynamically adapt to pathological variations, effectively resolving local textural complexity. In the later stage, VRWKV blocks with linear attention mechanisms were used to efficiently model long-range spatial dependencies, reducing the computational overhead of traditional Transformers. Additionally, a lightweight HamDecoder was integrated for multi-scale feature fusion and denoising. Extensive experiments were conducted on two datasets (KPIs for mouse glomeruli and HuBMAP for human glomeruli), with quantitative evaluations against 11 SOTA models using metrics like mDSC, HD95, and IoU, alongside ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each component.</li>            
                    <li><strong>Result:</strong> DualSeg showed superior performance and strong effectiveness across multiple datasets, with its effectiveness and generalization verified by comparative and ablation experiments—offering a novel solution for clinical practice. On the KPIs dataset, it achieved the highest average mDSC (92.98%) and lowest variance (0.0016), a 2.85% improvement over the best baseline (VRWKV: 90.13%), demonstrating robustness across different pathologies. For complex pathologies (e.g., 5/6Nx), its mDSC reached 90.07% (4.69% above baseline) and HD95 dropped to 149.61 (20.4% reduction), proving capability in handling challenging cases. On the HuBMAP test set, DualSeg attained mDSC scores of 89.79% (private) and 83.73% (public), outperforming SOTA models like SegFormer (88.53%/80.51%) and DA-TransUNet.</li>             -->

                    <li>In the pathological analysis of colorectal cancer, the proportion relying on manual analysis is high, with defects of inefficiency and subjectivity. The existing technologies do not fully utilize the features of multi-color spaces. In this study, three color spaces, namely RGB, HSV, and LAB*, were compared. By combining traditional features (such as 3D GLCM) with deep features (such as ResNet), a multi-color and multi-feature fusion framework was constructed. On the Kather dataset, the classification accuracy rate reached as high as 98.60%, which helps with themated analysis of the patholog autoy of colorectal cancer.</li>
                    <!-- <li><strong>Background:</strong> Colorectal cancer is a common malignant tumor in China, and its diagnosis and prognosis rely heavily on pathological image analysis. However, traditional pathological analysis mainly depends on pathologists’ manual observation, which is not only inefficient but also easily affected by subjective factors—leading to potential inconsistencies in results. Although machine learning and deep learning technologies have been applied to this field to address these issues, a key challenge remains: existing solutions fail to fully leverage image features from different color spaces, which limits further improvements in the accuracy of colorectal cancer pathological image recognition.
                    <li><strong>Task:</strong> This study set out to address the aforementioned challenge by first comparing the performance of three key color spaces (RGB, HSV, LAB*). On this basis, it aimed to combine traditional feature extraction methods (such as 3D Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix) with deep learning models (ResNet, EfficientNet). The ultimate goal was to construct a classification framework that integrates multi-color spaces and multi-modal features, thereby enhancing the recognition performance of machine learning in colorectal cancer pathological image analysis.
                    <li><strong>Methodoloogy:</strong> To achieve the research task, we implemented three core actions. First, it researched and deployed classic traditional feature extraction algorithms—including 3D Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (3D GLCM), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and Wavelet Packet Transform—to extract texture features from pathological images. Second, it learned and built mainstream deep learning models (ResNet, EfficientNet), utilizing their strong adaptive feature learning capabilities to extract deep-level image features that are difficult to capture with traditional methods. Third, we designed and implemented a classification framework that integrates multi-color spaces and multi-modal features, effectively fusing the extracted traditional features and deep features. Additionally, we conducted comparative analysis to evaluate performance differences between different color spaces, different feature extraction methods, and the proposed fusion framework in the colorectal cancer pathological image recognition task.
                    <li><strong>Result:</strong> This research yielded notable outcomes in colorectal cancer pathological image recognition. First, the proposed classification framework—integrating multi-color spaces and multi-modal features—achieved significant performance improvements, with the highest classification accuracy reaching 98.60%. Compared to solutions relying on a single color space or feature extraction method, it effectively boosted recognition ability and addressed the limitations of traditional single-modal approaches. Second, by leveraging the advantages of specific color spaces (RGB, HSV, LAB*) and complementary feature extraction methods (traditional + deep learning), the team built an efficient, accurate classification scheme for such images. This scheme offers strong technical support for colorectal cancer’s early diagnosis and subsequent treatment, laying a foundation for more standardized, automated pathological analysis. -->
