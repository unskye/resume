                    <li><strong>Background:</strong> Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) impacts over 9% of the global population, with its core histological features being glomerulosclerosis and renal interstitial fibrosis—making glomerular pathological changes a key target for CKD treatment. However, expert manual analysis, annotation, and diagnosis of glomeruli in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) are highly time-consuming and labor-intensive, creating an urgent demand for automated, high-precision glomerular segmentation tools. Existing solutions such as CNNs and ViTs fall short in addressing three core challenges of glomerular images: local textural variability, spatial heterogeneity, and multi-scale morphological priors, resulting in a lack of unified and effective automated approaches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Task:</strong> The project aimed to develop a robust automated framework that integrates local feature extraction and global context modeling within a single unified architecture. This framework needed to overcome the limitations of traditional models, achieve high-precision segmentation for complex pathological glomeruli (e.g., fibrotic or morphologically variant glomeruli), and ultimately provide a practical automated tool for renal histopathological analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Methodoloogy:</strong> To achieve the goal, we designed DualSeg, a dual-stage hybrid framework combining CNN and Visual Recurrent Weighted Key-Value (VRWKV) technologies. In the early stage, Wave-Swin blocks (plug-and-play modules) were deployed to enhance multi-directional semantic feature extraction and dynamically adapt to pathological variations, effectively resolving local textural complexity. In the later stage, VRWKV blocks with linear attention mechanisms were used to efficiently model long-range spatial dependencies, reducing the computational overhead of traditional Transformers. Additionally, a lightweight HamDecoder (based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization) was integrated for multi-scale feature fusion and denoising. Extensive experiments were conducted on two datasets (KPIs for mouse glomeruli and HuBMAP for human glomeruli), with quantitative evaluations against 11 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models using metrics like mDSC, HD95, and IoU, alongside ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each component.</li>            
                    <li><strong>Result:</strong> DualSeg achieved superior performance and strong effectiveness across multiple datasets, with comparative and ablation experiments confirming its effectiveness and generalization capability—providing a novel solution for clinical practice. On the KPIs dataset, the model attained the highest average mDSC (92.98%) and the lowest variance (0.0016), representing a 2.85% improvement over the best baseline (VRWKV: 90.13%) and demonstrating robustness across different pathology types. For complex pathologies (e.g., 5/6Nx), its mDSC reached 90.07% (a 4.69% improvement over the baseline) and HD95 decreased to 149.61 (a 20.4% reduction), proving its ability to handle challenging cases. On the HuBMAP test set, DualSeg achieved mDSC scores of 89.79% (private) and 83.73% (public), outperforming SOTA models such as SegFormer (88.53%/80.51%) and DA-TransUNet.</li>

                    <li><strong>Background:</strong> Colorectal cancer is a common malignant tumor in China, and its diagnosis and prognosis rely heavily on pathological image analysis. However, traditional pathological analysis mainly depends on pathologists’ manual observation, which is not only inefficient but also easily affected by subjective factors—leading to potential inconsistencies in results. Although machine learning and deep learning technologies have been applied to this field to address these issues, a key challenge remains: existing solutions fail to fully leverage image features from different color spaces, which limits further improvements in the accuracy of colorectal cancer pathological image recognition.
                    <li><strong>Task:</strong> This study set out to address the aforementioned challenge by first comparing the performance of three key color spaces (RGB, HSV, LAB*). On this basis, it aimed to combine traditional feature extraction methods (such as 3D Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix) with deep learning models (ResNet, EfficientNet). The ultimate goal was to construct a classification framework that integrates multi-color spaces and multi-modal features, thereby enhancing the recognition performance of machine learning in colorectal cancer pathological image analysis.
                    <li><strong>Methodoloogy:</strong> To achieve the research task, we implemented three core actions. First, it researched and deployed classic traditional feature extraction algorithms—including 3D Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (3D GLCM), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and Wavelet Packet Transform—to extract texture features from pathological images. Second, it learned and built mainstream deep learning models (ResNet, EfficientNet), utilizing their strong adaptive feature learning capabilities to extract deep-level image features that are difficult to capture with traditional methods. Third, we designed and implemented a classification framework that integrates multi-color spaces and multi-modal features, effectively fusing the extracted traditional features and deep features. Additionally, we conducted comparative analysis to evaluate performance differences between different color spaces, different feature extraction methods, and the proposed fusion framework in the colorectal cancer pathological image recognition task.
                    <li><strong>Result:</strong> The research achieved notable outcomes in colorectal cancer pathological image recognition. First, the proposed classification framework—integrating multi-color spaces and multi-modal features—delivered significant performance improvements, with the highest classification accuracy reaching 98.60%. Compared with solutions relying on a single color space or a single feature extraction method, this framework effectively enhanced the ability to recognize colorectal cancer pathological images, addressing the limitations of traditional single-modal approaches. Second, by reasonably exploiting the advantages of different color spaces (RGB, HSV, LAB*) and complementary feature extraction methods (traditional + deep learning), the team successfully constructed an efficient and accurate classification scheme for colorectal cancer pathological images. This scheme provides strong technical support for the early diagnosis and subsequent treatment of colorectal cancer, laying a foundation for more standardized and automated pathological analysis.
